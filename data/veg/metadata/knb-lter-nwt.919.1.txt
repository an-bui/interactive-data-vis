    Vegetation coverage digitized from 1:10,000 map. Vegetation classification follows Komarkova's (1979) classification system (Braun-Blanquet) units. See Peddle and Duguay (1995) for additional information on digitization and map production for this vegetation coverage. See Braun-Blanquet (1964), Komarkova and Webber (1978), and Komarkova (1979, 1980) for additional information on vegetation classification used in this dataset.

    This coverage generated was outside of the Tundra Ecosystem Analysis and Mapping Laboratory (TEAML) (both by students/workers for Claude Duguay in Canada). May have been compacted from the north somehow. Definitely some errors within.

        2019-02-22: Coverage topology fields removed from shapefile attribute table, field names corrected, and .dbf written out in R using package 'foreign' v.0.8-70. Shapefile xml metadata edited for FGDC compliance and written out in R using package 'XML' v3.98-1.16.[CTW, NWT GRA]

See Peddle and Duguay (1995) for additional information on digitization and map production for this vegetation coverage.

Source map from Komarkova (1980); map digitized in spring of 1997.
            This dataset has been converted from coverage to shapefile format for greater user accessibility. Shapefiles do not store topology and so topology from the coverage dataset was not transferred to the shapefile during conversion. If interested in data topology, please see the ArcInfo interchange file, veg.e00 (available in data package download), for the original coverage dataset with topology preserved. An .e00 file can be imported in ArcGIS Desktop applications via ArcToolbox tools: Conversion > To Coverage > Import from E00. It may also be read in to R via the 'readGDAL' function in R package 'rgdal'. Please note if import from .e00, the metadata displayed for the coverage will not be current.
