Dataset Abstract

	This vector shapefile is a polygon shapefile outlining the extent of the "NWT" project area, for the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) project. The shapefile also covers the Green Lakes Valley portion of the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory (CZO). Other datasets available in this series includes orthorectified aerial photograph mosaics (for 1953, 1972, 1985, approximately 1990, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008), digital elevation models (DEM's), and accessory map layers. Together, the DEM's and imagery will be of interest to students, research scientists, and others for observation and analysis of natural features and ecosystems.
							NOTE: This EML metadata file does not contain important geospatial 
							data processing information. Before using any NWT LTER geospatial 
							data read the arcgis metadata XML file in either ISO or FGDC compliant 
							format, using ArcGIS software (ArcCatalog > description), or by 
							viewing the .xml file provided with the geospatial dataset.
