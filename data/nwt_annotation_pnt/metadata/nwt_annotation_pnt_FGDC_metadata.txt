    Description:
      Abstract: Point shapefile of commonly referenced locations at Niwot Ridge, Green Lakes Valley, and surrounding area.
      Purpose: Point locations of landmarks or commonly referenced sites are useful for map display and annotation.
      Supplemental_Information:
        No information on dataset creator, date of creation, nor methods or sources used to generate dataset. Used in Figure 1.5 (Niwot Ridge overview map) in Bowman (2001). Temporal coverage specified with begin date of 1990, when Tundra Lab construction was completed, and spans to present date, however other locations annotated existed prior to 1990.

        Note, 2019-02-22: This dataset was made in the 1990s and has been minimally maintained since then (e.g. metadata may have been updated). While best reasonable effort has been made to quality check and describe this dataset, the data and metadata are provided largely as produced and described as they were when created.
